      "My Little Darling: So you are crying from morning until night and from night until morning, because your husband leaves you; you do not know what to do and so you ask your old aunt for advice; you must consider her quite an expert. You say that you are all attention, love, kisses and caresses for him. Perhaps that is the very trouble; I think you kiss him too much. Man is gifted with physical strength, and he exercises force. It is our weapon, formidable and invincible, but we should know how to use it. To tell the history of Love from the beginning of the world would be to tell the history of man himself: Everything springs from it, the arts, great events, customs, wars, the overthrow of empires. Therefore we reign supreme, all-powerful. But, like kings, we must make use of delicate diplomacy. A preface which can always be read over again, whereas one cannot always read over the book. Do you remember the verses of Sully-Prudhomme:\n",
      "Caresses are nothing but anxious bliss,\n",
      "Vain attempts of love to unite souls through a kiss. After describing the expectancy of a lover, waiting in a room one winter's evening, his anxiety, his nervous impatience, the terrible fear of not seeing her, he describes the arrival of the beloved woman, who at last enters hurriedly, out of breath, bringing with her part of the winter breeze, and he exclaims:\n",
      "Oh! The taste of the kisses first snatched through the veil. The young woman has walked quickly; the veil is moist from her cold breath. Therefore, the value of this caress being entirely a matter of convention, we must be careful not to abuse it. Well, my dear, I have several times noticed that you are very clumsy. You had been paying no attention to it, and it was almost out. A few lingering embers were glowing on the hearth. Then when you freed him, you began to grumble: \"How badly you kiss!\" An ill-placed kiss may do any amount of harm.\n",

Quietly,\" they said, \"or we shall wake them.\" Now they've found it,' one would be certain, stopping the pencil on the margin. And then, tired of reading, one might rise and see for oneself, the house all empty, the doors standing open, only the wood pigeons bubbling with content and the hum of the threshing machine sounding from the farm. \" And so down again, the garden still as ever, only the book had slipped into the grass. But they had found it in the drawing room. The windowpanes reflected apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass. Safe, safe, safe\" the pulse of the house beat softly. \" But the trees spun darkness for a wandering beam of sun. Death was the glass; death was between us, coming to the woman first, hundreds of years ago, leaving the house, sealing all the windows; the rooms were darkened. Safe, safe, safe,\" the pulse of the house beat gladly. ' Moonbeams splash and spill wildly in the rain. But the beam of the lamp falls straight from the window. Wandering through the house, opening the windows, whispering not to wake us, the ghostly couple seek their joy. The wind falls, the rain slides silver down the glass. Wild beams of moonlight cross both floor and wall, and, meeting, stain the faces bent; the faces pondering; the faces that search the sleepers and seek their hidden joy. Here we left our treasure--\" Stooping, their light lifts the lids upon my eyes. \" Waking, I cry \"Oh, is this your buried treasure?\n",

You see, with a thing like a marquee,\" and he turned to Laura in his easy way, \"you want to put it somewhere where it'll give you a bang slap in the eye, if you follow me.\" When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the karakas in her wonder at him caring for things like that - caring for the smell of lavender. said Laura, and the sound was like a little moan. She crouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies; she felt they were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast. I was passing the shop yesterday, and I saw them in the window. The florist's man was still outside at his van. Tell mother and Miss Laura to come here at once. \"This Life is Wee-ary, Hope comes to Die. \"If you please, m'm, cook says have you got the flags for the sandwiches?\" \"But, my dear child, use your common sense. This time Mrs. Sheridan lost patience just as Jose had done. And it's not very sympathetic to spoil everybody's enjoyment as you're doing now.\" Daddy darling, can't the band have something to drink?\" Lived just below in the lane, and leaves a wife and half a dozen kiddies, so they say.\" What a point to have it all ready prepared. It was as though she was expected, as though they had known she was coming here. Step this way, please, miss,\" she said in an oily voice, and Laura followed her. She seemed as though she couldn't understand why Laura was there. What did garden-parties and baskets and lace frocks matter to him? She found her way out of the door, down the path, past all those dark people.\n",

      "OLENKA, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her back porch, lost in thought. They don't understand anything of that sort. In the end his misfortunes touched her; she grew to love him. In earlier days she had loved her papa, who now sat in a darkened room, breathing with difficulty; she had loved her aunt who used to come every other year from Bryansk; and before that, when she was at school, she had loved her French master. In the evenings and at night she could head the band playing, and the crackling and banging of fireworks, and it seemed to her that it was Kukin struggling with his destiny, storming the entrenchments of his chief foe, the indifferent public; there was a sweet thrill at her heart, she had no desire to sleep, and when he returned home at day-break, she tapped softly at her bedroom window, and showing him only her face and one shoulder through the curtain, she gave him a friendly smile. . . . Olenka had received telegrams from her husband before, but this time for some reason she felt numb with terror. AWAITING IMMATE INSTRUCTIONS FUFUNERAL TUESDAY.\" There was a pleasant fragrance about them both, and her silk dress rustled agreeably. And when Pustovalov came back, she told him in a low voice about the veterinary surgeon and his unhappy home life, and both sighed and shook their heads and talked about the boy, who, no doubt, missed his father, and by some strange connection of ideas, they went up to the holy ikons, bowed to the ground before them and prayed that God would give them children. She repeated the veterinary surgeon's words, and was of the same opinion as he about everything. Neither she nor the veterinary surgeon said anything to other people of the change in their relations, and tried, indeed, to conceal it, but without success, for Olenka could not keep a secret. She looked into her yard without interest, thought of nothing, wished for nothing, and afterwards, when night came on she went to bed and dreamed of her empty yard. Besides, it's time for my boy to go to school. \"She's at the hotel with the boy, and I'm looking for lodgings.\" Now she had opinions of her own, and at supper she talked to Sasha's parents, saying how difficult the lessons were at the high schools, but that yet the high school was better than a commercial one, since with a high-school education all careers were open to one, such as being a doctor or an engineer.\n",

      "“It’s a remarkable apparatus,” said the Officer to the Explorer and gazed with a certain look of admiration at the device, with which he was, of course, thoroughly familiar. He had not been listening with full attention. At the head of the Bed here, where the man, as I have mentioned, first lies face down, is this small protruding lump of felt, which can easily be adjusted so that it presses right into the man’s mouth. Yes, it is,” said the Officer smiling, “feel it for yourself.” However, the fact that with such an eminent visitor”—the Traveler tried to deflect the honor with both hands, but the Officer insisted on the expression—“that with such an eminent visitor he didn’t even once make him aware of the form of our sentencing is yet again something new, which.…” He has had no opportunity to defend himself,” said the Officer and looked away, as if he were talking to himself and did not wish to embarrass the Traveler with an explanation of matters he would find so self-evident. “ Don’t you want to come closer and see the needles for yourself?” But the Officer held the Traveler firmly with one hand, and with the other he took a lump of earth from the wall and threw it at the Soldier. Something was still not working properly, something only he noticed. While the Soldier was busy with the right hand, the Condemned Man stretched out his left, with no sense of its direction. After this verdict of such a personality it is, of course, no longer possible for me to tolerate this procedure. He knows that I am no expert in judicial processes. Place your hands where everyone can see them. In his place, the Traveler would not have acted any differently. The Soldier might perhaps have been ready to do that, but the Condemned Man took the order as a direct punishment. He wanted to push against the feet himself and have the two others grab the Officer’s head from the other side, so he could be slowly lifted off the needles. At this point, almost against his will, the Traveler looked at the face of the corpse. *        *        *\n",

      "As the Traveler, with the Soldier and the Condemned Man behind him, came to the first houses in the colony, the Soldier pointed to one and said, “That’s the tea house.” Although there was little difference between the tea house and the rest of the houses in the colony, which were all very dilapidated except for the Commandant’s palatial structure, the Traveler was nonetheless struck by the impression of historical memory, and he felt the power of earlier times. For a while people were undecided where they should bury him.\n",
